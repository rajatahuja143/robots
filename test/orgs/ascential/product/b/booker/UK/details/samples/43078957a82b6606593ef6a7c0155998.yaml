              - text: "The Glenlivet Founder's Reserve is an award winning single malt scotch
                  whisky. It captures the distinct, smooth, fruity taste that
                  its founder first envisioned. It's a classic single malt style
                  of whisky but with an innovative contemporary fresh taste. It
                  starts with a skillful selection of casks that enhances the
                  signature fruity flavours of The Glenlivet. The traditional
                  oak casks are complemented by selective use of American
                  first-fill casks to give a hint of creamy sweetness - creating
                  an exceptionally well-balanced and smooth malt. Sold with its
                  signature blue gift box, making this the perfect whisky to
                  celebrate a special occasion. Serving suggestion: Drink to
                  your own preference, straight up or with a drop of water to
                  open the creamy and intensely smooth character. When serving
                  with ice, large cubes are recommended to allow slow dilution
                  releasing the creamy, sweet characters. George Smith, The
                  Glenlivet's founder, didn't follow the lead of the illegal
                  still owners. In 1824, he obtained a distiller's licence to
                  become the first legal distiller in Glenlivet, Scotland. 50
                  years later, George finally won the exclusive right to call
                  his whisky ‘The Glenlivet', definitively marking it as the
                  single malt that started it all. To this day, The Glenlivet
                  remains the benchmark that all other Speyside single malts are
                  measured against."
